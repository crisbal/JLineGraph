This is a custom Java Swing Component you can use to draw really simple line graphs. 

This was done for a school assignment.

Check out the example java file to see how to use the component. It is really easy. 


TODO:

Sort by x the array

Maybe switch to ArrayList

Add value indicator

Maybe add a grid
